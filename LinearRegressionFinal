What y = f(x) = mx+c is doing
What dy/dx is doing 
What the sign (+/-) is doing for m --> The direction (Go up (or) Go down) to achieve the minimum value of the function
What the value of m is doing --> Slope --> How much you need to lean

If the function is differentiable, then you can definitly find the global minima or local minima.

y = mx + c is a 2D function


Linear Regression:

y --> A label
x --> A feature
