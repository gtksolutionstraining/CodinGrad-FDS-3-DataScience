What y = f(x) = mx+c is doing
What dy/dx is doing 
What the sign (+/-) is doing for m --> The direction (Go up (or) Go down) to achieve the minimum value of the function
What the value of m is doing --> Slope --> How much you need to lean

If the function is differentiable, then you can definitly find the global minima or local minima.

y = mx + c is a 2D function


Linear Regression:

y --> A label
x --> A feature

y --> A label
x1,x2,x3,x4,... --> Features

y = m1*x1 + m2*x2 + ..... + mn*xn + c

y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ..... + wn*xn + b
    w --> Weight
    b --> Bias

Dataset CSV --> Rows and Columns

Rows --> Examples, Observations
Columns --> Features, Variables

number of examples = m
number of features = n 
label =  y

Example: Titanic Dataset
1. m = 418
2. n = 4
3. y = 1 --> Survived
