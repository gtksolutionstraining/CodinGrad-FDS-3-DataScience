Number of features = n 
Number of examples = m
Number of neurons in layer 1 = l1
Number of output neuron = 1


The shapes of the weight --> 

    W1 = (n,l1), b1 = (l1,)
    W2 = (l1,1), b2 = (1,)

    Z1 = W1.T @ X + b1

        (l1,n) (n,m)

    (l1,m) = (l1,m) + (l1,)

    A1 = (l1,m)

    Z2 = W2.T @ A1 + b1

        = (1,l1) (l1,m)
        = (1,m) + (1,)
