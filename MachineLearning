2. Semi Supervised Machine Learning
    --> Will have the supervision and also will generate the data.
    --> Classification ==> Movie Feedback ==> Classify ==> 4*
        --> Training Data
            1. Astonished --> 5
            2. Good --------> 4
            3. Average ------> 3
            4. Well Performed --> 5
            5. I was in different world while watching movie --> 5
        --> Reviews ==> based on the knowledge that the model has, model will cluster the review and send it for review.
    --> Classification Model ==> Cluster the movie reviews.
3. Unsupervised Machine Learning
    --> Clustering the data
        1. K Means, Eucleadian Distance
            X - is an example
            X -> (X11,X12,X13,....)
                 (X21,X22,X23,....)
            D -> sqrt((X21-X11)^2 + (X22-X12)^2 + ....)
        2. KNN
4. Reinforcement Machine Learning
    --> If ML model predicts something it will get penalty or a bounty
