                2. Historgram
                3. Bar Chart
                4. Scatter Plot
                5. Density Plot
                6. Line Plot 
            2. Summarizing the data
                1. Basic Summary
                2. Measures of Central Tendencies
                3. Data Distributions
                    1. Probability Density functions

Major Components of the Data:
    1. Rows  --> Observations, Examples, Experiments, Tuple, Records, Instances, Data Point
        1. Pharma Industry:
            --> What chemicals should be mixed in what percentages
            --> Huge number of experiments to invent a new drug
            --> Experiment1 --> (Ca-1,Mag-2,.....)
    2. Columns --> Feature, Variable, Attribute, Field
            --> Numerical Features --> A feature will have continuos data
                --> Interval Scaled --> Interval or subtraction or addition of continuous data make sense here and ratio or division or multiplication doesn't make any sense
                --> Ratio Scaled --> Addition,Subtraction, Multiplication and Division(Ratio) these operations make sense on the data
            --> Categorical Features --> A feature will have discrete values --> Limited discrete values
                ---> Categorical Threshold = 50
                ---> Unary Features ==> Only 1 Discrete value
                ---> Binary Features ==> Only 2 Discrete Values
                ---> Nominal Features ==> more than 2 discrete values
                    --> marital_status ==> single,married, divorced, widow
                    --> Important Nominal Features --> marital_status
                    --> Non Important Nominal Features --> passenger_ID, All primary keys are non important nominal features, EMPLOYEE_ID
